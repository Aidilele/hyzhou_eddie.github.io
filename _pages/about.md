Biography
======
My research mainly focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph neural network (GNN), including diffusion model,
multi-agent system. I got my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Xidian University(XDU), advised by [Prof.
Guangming Shi](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/gmshi/)

I am looking for a PhD opportunity for 2025 intake. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested.
